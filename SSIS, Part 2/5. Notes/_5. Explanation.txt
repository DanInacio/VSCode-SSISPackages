Data captured by Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) change slowly but unpredictably,
rather than according to a regular schedule

Whenever a specific column is undergoing some changes, we would like to set an END DATE
to that record and insert a new record with the date as NULL
That way, we figure out what is the current value for an entry
