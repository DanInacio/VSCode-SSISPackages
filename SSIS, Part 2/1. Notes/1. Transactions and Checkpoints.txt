Transactions

- At package level, set it as required!
- You must (NOLOCK) in your SQL Queries
because your tables will be locked during the transaction!
- If the package fails, no data will be actually inserted,
even if you viewed it mid-transaction with a (NOLOCK) query!

DO NOT USE Transactions and Checkpoints in the SAME PACKAGE!

When using checkpoints with a package that uses cache, make sure:
- Cache Connection Manager uses FILE CACHE!
